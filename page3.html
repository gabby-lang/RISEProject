<h1 class="title">Why the partnership?</h1>

<p>The Ragon Institute of Mass General, MIT, and Harvard have a crucial role to play in partnering with research in South Africa due to the country's significant burden of the HIV pandemic. As South Africa faces one of the largest HIV epidemics in the world, it presents a unique and critical opportunity for research and intervention. By collaborating with research efforts in South Africa, the Ragon Institute can contribute its expertise and resources to address the specific challenges and needs of the population affected by HIV in the country.</p>
